# Typescript For Node
The aim of the article is to build, structure, test and debug a Node.js application in TypeScript.

## Why there is a need of Typescript over Vanilla JavaScript
Managing large-scale JavaScript projects can be challenging, as you need to guarantee that the pieces fit together. You can use unit tests, types (which JavaScript does not really have), or the two in combination to solve this issue.

This is where TypeScript comes into the picture. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## The benefits of using TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of Javascript. It gives you the following benefits:

* optional static typing, with emphasis on optional (it makes porting JavaScript application to TypeScript easy),
* as a developer, you can start using ECMAScript features that are not supported by the current V8 engine by using build targets,
* use of interfaces,
* great tooling with instruments like IntelliSense.
